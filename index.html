<p>Trade, Kris, Letang. Great guy I'm sure. Penguin from day 1. but wow is it time to trade him. Have you ever made 7.25 million to be the soul reason for losing 6 games in the Stanley cup playoffs? Me neither, but Kris makes it look like an art</p>

<p>Need more evidence. Like <b>7.25 million</b>
 worth? Here's the man himself <a innertext="saying he's responsible for Game 5 loss" href="http://www.sportingnews.com/nhl/news/kris-letang-accepts-blame-penguins-game-5-loss/99y8vbo2ze1k159yw5mh5az9u" title="Kris, it's time to move on" target="_blank">saying he's responsible for Game 5 loss</a>
. I expect a Game 6 article as well though he'd be good to say that he's the reason for 2 losses to a pathetic Philadelphia team and all 4 losses to a below average Capitals team.</p>
<p>But I mean, it's not all bad. Look at this great highlight real of Kris putting guys head first into the goal. He's so damn clutch he doesn't need to be in the play, it's fantastic at being in the box, or chasing guys on blown coverage, or turn overs. Oh hell, let's not forget turn overs. That's a huge part of the $7.25 million dollar hit. If I had a dollar for every break away turn over by Letang I'd have at least 1/2 of that $7.25 million.</p>

<h2>sigh</h2>
<p>Great season pens. well... great 11 seasons. This has been an insane run and it has to end eventually, but it wouldn't have had to if we had traded Letang when it was clear that we should. Grim Rutherford, I leave it at your feet. This team only has about 2 years left to actually do something before a total rebuild. Make the move. Trade Letang for.... literally anyone.</p>

<p>Sorry, might need to throw in a few draft picks. I mean Stanley Cup champion Phil Kessel at least came with keeping some cap, so you know Letang will force at least a few picks to go out the door just for a garbage company to take him. Ottowa's looking good. Maybe the Coyotes or Vancouver. Those are great places to end a career. West coast would do Kris well, he could finish out his career watching Vegas Golden Knights games.</p>
